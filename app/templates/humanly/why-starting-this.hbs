                <p> Hey there, and welcome to my tiny little
                    "experimental blog". Well, answering the title's question, I'm starting this little experiment to
                    get better at writing.</p>
                <div class="post__image">

                </div>

                <p class="--margin-top-l"> What I recognized from the latest experimental projects that I did, was that
                    I don't write much about the process I pass through to come with a specific solution, I just post
                    the solution itself and that's it. Which doesn't give the full image of the solution, and it doesn't
                    explain why I believe that this solution would reflect the best outcome for the product. All these
                    questions started to come on my mind when I was putting together a new portfolio, that has dedicated
                    pages for various projects, and all that I added in these pages was the name of the project and a
                    link to a graphical presentation, okay but where is the process of this, how I came to this design
                    solutions. Here when I found that there's a problem, and I'm not presenting my work the right way.
                </p>


                <p class="--margin-top-l">
                     Asking myself why I'm not writing much about it, I came up with
                    answers such as; I lack writing skills, or I got into the trap of thinking that posting images of
                    the design solutions is enough, that if we want to talk only about presenting work, and not sharing
                    knowledge, because oh snap! I don't do this too!
                </p>

                <p class="--margin-top-l">I have this feeling that I'm sharing a lot of images but not much of thoughts,
                    and to be honest I don't know how I came to this place, and I feel that I will come over this by
                    starting this "experimental blog", writing more about my process, and sharing more knowledge and
                    learning on the way.</p>
