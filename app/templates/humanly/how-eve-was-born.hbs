                <h2>What was eve anyway?</h2>
                <p>Eve provides basic user interface elements, flexbox based responsive interfaces, pure CSS components
                    with best practice coding and a consistent design system.</p>
                <a href="https://kanbanize.github.io/eve/" class="body__link" target="_blank">A link to eve's
                    homepage</a>

                <p class="--margin-top-l">It all started while designing the
                    interface of flow-e. I decided to break the interface into components and add them to a sketch
                    library, so it will be much faster to reuse them for future features, and most importantly more
                    consistent and everything would be on sync.
                    After finishing the basic interface and starting working on other minor features, I showed <a
                        href="https://github.com/hpivanov" class="body__link" target="_blank">my partner in crime "the
                        front-end developer of Flow-e"</a>, the process I pass through and how I re-use components, and
                    how when I change it in one place "using symbols in sketch" it just changes everywhere. We discussed
                    how this can happen on the front-end side of the product "design systems were a hot topic and
                    everyone was talking about them" he also believed that this would make his work faster, easier and
                    way more consistent.
                </p>

                <p class="--margin-top-l">
                    We pitched our idea to management and told them that we believe
                    that this is an important matter, doing it now while the product is still in its early stages will
                    pay us a lot in the future, moreover will make the UI Architecture of the product a lot better and
                    easier to scale. At the time management believed that we need to work on other MVP's and that a
                    Design System for the product will not give back the desired outcome and what early adopters were
                    expecting from our product.
                </p>

                <p class="--margin-top-l">Going a little bit back, <a href="https://flow-e.com" class="body__link"
                        target="_blank">Flow-e</a> is a part of parent company <a href="https://kanbanize.com"
                        class="body__link" target="_blank">Kanbanize</a>, a project management software that further
                    revolutionizes the Kanban and Lean concepts so that you can keep an eye on all your projects at
                    once. That how Flow-e was born, out of our desire to apply Lean to the inbox. As students of Lean
                    and power users of email, we couldnâ€™t help but see the connection between the methodology we were
                    using to run our organization and the development of our original product, Kanbanize, and the
                    challenges we faced when it came to our inbox.</p>
                <p class="--margin-top-l">
                    I'm mentioning Kanbanize because as a product it's way larger than Flow-e, and while working on it
                    we understood that Design Systems are important and if you try to scale your product without using a
                    consistent system you will end up with what I like to call an SUI "Spaghetti User Interface" from
                    both visual and code basis.</p>

                    Going back to the management and our pitch plus our poor
                    experience in negotiating with them. We decided to take the hard way, build it on our own with our
                    free time. From my side things were clear, I had the components, all that I needed to do is to split
                    them into categories and make sure what are the basis that needs to be done. We were so motivated to
                    work on this one because we believed it will have a great outcome on the product. After working for
                    several weeks on creating and developing the components and testing how they would work together we
                    decided to implement it in flow-e, it was a young product still and if things went bananas it was
                    easy to revert everything without creating any catastrophes, the plan now is to experiment and if we
                    fail to fail as fast as possible.

                <h2>Oh my!</h2>
                <p>Things worked as smooth as it should be, that's all because of our understanding of the product and
                    its needs and the quality code that my partner in crime wrote. The code was a damn poetry. You would
                    enjoy looking at the SASS he wrote and the way he orchestrated everything. I learned a lot about
                    breaking SASS files just by looking at his code and trying to figure out what he did, the way he
                    broke down things into variables and the way he mapped them together using loops, the whole thing
                    was a beauty and worked like a charm.</p>

                <h2>Moment of truth.</h2>
                <p>We synced with management about what we did, what we created so far and the process of implementing
                    it in flow-e, including how our process for future features would look like and what outcome this
                    brought to the product. They understood, actually, they didn't only understand what we did, they
                    finally understood what a design system is, and decided to implement eve also into Kanbanize.</p>

                <p>While implementing Eve into Kanbanize we deleted almost 15,000 lines of code!
                    Are you following? Fifteen thousand lines of code, thousands!</p>

                </div>

                <h2>The outcome of eve on Kanbanize was higher than we thought.</h2>
                <p>Better performance, consistency, faster implementation for new features, easier improvement of the
                    older ones, also an eye opener for the need of better architecture for the front-end base of the
                    product.</p>

                <p class="--margin-top-l">
                    I learned a lot while creating and implementing Eve into both
                    products. I now have a better overview of UI Architecture and the importance of Front-end knowledge
                    on my work as a Designer. I was in this phase of improving my Front-end knowledge at the time and
                    this helped me a lot in writing code more fluently, that all thanks for my partner in crime and
                    Kanbanize Family for adopting the idea.
