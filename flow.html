                <h1>Flow-e provides an elegant kanban-like workflow that's combined with the ideas behind inbox zero
                    inside your Gmail and Outlook. flow-e transforms your inbox into a central todo app.</h1>
                <p>I was the sole product designer in a team of 5. My role started by recognizing users who work with
                    email excessively, identifying their pain points in the process, and determining the fittest
                    solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project__section ">
                <h2>Who is our ideal user?</h2>
                <p>Users who get 100+ emails a day. Someone who communicates with a high number and a wide variety of
                    people in a single day through an
                    email. Enthusiast of efficiency and running many parallel projects with hundreds of stakeholders
                    that want to keep the communication Lean.</p>

                <h2>What is the problem we are trying to solve?</h2>
                <p>Email clients are productivity tools, but the way they present email is often too rigid because we
                    currently work with email.</p>
                <p>The truth is, today, we need a seamless way to manage emails as tasks, in addition to tracking
                    to-dos, monitoring our time, staying organized, and balancing multiple projects and priorities at
                    once. The existing email clients folder-and-flag system isn't complex enough to meet our rapidly
                    changing needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project__section ">
                <h2>How are we going to solve it?</h2>
                <p>A Lean email process can save your inbox.</p>
                <p>It has the potential to keep you on the ball when it comes to incoming messages and the actionable
                    work items that come flooding in along with them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project__section ">
                <h2>But why?</h2>
                <p>Flow-e was born out of our desire to apply Lean to the inbox.</p>
                <p>As students of Lean and power users of email, we couldn't help but see the connection between the
                    methodology we were using to run our organization and the development of our original product,
                    Kanbanize, and the challenges we faced when it came to our inbox.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project__section ">
                <h2>What is Lean methodology?</h2>
                <p>Lean represents creating as much value as possible without wasting any resources in the process.

                <h2>What design approach we took?</h2>
                <p>Dividing the inbox interface between a feed of incoming mail and a visual email workflow provides a
                    better way to differentiate between your communication stages.</p>
                <p>The email that makes it into the workflow will be the actionable communication only ‚Äì everything else
                    needs to be sorted out. Within the visual email workflow, actionable emails move through predefined
                    stages but remain visible at all times. The columns that represent these stages in the workflow are
                    customizable to suit your process.</p>
